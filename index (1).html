            <div class="content">
                <p>A front end developer, also known as a front end web developer, is a professional responsible for the
                    design and implementation of the interface. The users require this interface so that they can access
                    the application in question. A web designer is a professional who creates a website’s appearance and
                    design. And the front end developer makes sure that the design works online by using coding
                    languages such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>they are programmers who have skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as some of the powerful
                    frameworks and libraries that can bring a user-focused website to life. Technologies like
                    Foundation, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Backbone, DOM, and EmberJS help to ensure that a site looks and
                    works well on any type of device, and coding libraries like LESS and jQuery help the site's users
                    save time. Front end developers use these platforms creatively to build better, more beautiful
                    experiences for website and application visitors everywhere. They also look for ways to improve and
                    maintain the user experience — especially as technology shifts and users develop different demands
                    and needs.</p>
